# aiIsMyth_ML_Project
This contains the project for the course CS550 : Machine Learning for the semester 2024-25M at IIT Bhilai.

The project is somewhat inspired by the this problem statement [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772375523000515). But we aim only to make the model using multiple pretrained model using transfer learning.

We have collected the dataset from two sources , [source1](https://zenodo.org/records/5801834) and [source2](https://zenodo.org/records/4628934)
